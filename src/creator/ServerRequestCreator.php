/**
 * PSR-7 ServerRequest creator for SAPI and worker environments.
 *
 * Provides a factory for creating {@see ServerRequestInterface} instances from PHP global variables, enabling seamless
 * interoperability between PSR-7 compatible HTTP stacks and Yii2 applications.
 *
 * This class delegates the creation of server requests, streams, and uploaded files to the provided PSR-7 factories,
 * supporting both traditional SAPI and worker-based environments.
 *
 * It ensures strict type safety and immutability throughout the request creation process.
 *
 * The creation process includes.
 * - Attaching the request body stream from 'php://input' for compatibility with raw payloads.
 * - Extracting HTTP method and URI from global variables.
 * - Handling uploaded files via {@see UploadedFileCreator} when present.
 * - Populating cookies, parsed body, and query parameters from PHP globals.
 *
 * Key features.
 * - Automatic handling of uploaded files and body streams.
 * - Designed for compatibility with SAPI and worker runtimes.
 * - Exception-safe body stream attachment.
 * - Immutable, type-safe request creation from PHP globals.
 * - PSR-7 factory integration for server requests, streams, and uploaded files.
